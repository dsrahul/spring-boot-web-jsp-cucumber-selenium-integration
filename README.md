I was looking all over the net for a good Spring boot webapp project that includes selenium tests using a webdriver. There were none or may be I was not looking at the right place.

So I decided to create an example that covers all these and can run on a build server.

Hopefully this will be of interest to others looking for something similar.

Run the tests using this command
```
mvn verify
```

Run the webapp using this command
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
